I'm playing Six Nations fantasy rugby. Please help select a team with these rules:

Team Selection:
- Can choose up to 15 players + one supersub (who gets 3x points)
- 3 back three, 2 centre, 1 fly-half, 1 scrum-half, 3 back row, 2 second-row, 2 prop and 1 hooker.
- Don't have to fill every position (can leave one or two positions empty)
- Maximum 4 players per country/club
- Supersub should typically be a bench player (not full 80 mins)
- Total fantasy_value cap of 230 points
- fantasy_value is how much a player costs
- points is how many points a player scored for a round
- Use as close to 230 as possible, should be at least >=225
- Consider fixture match ups (strength and weakness of each team)


- Create the team as a list
- Calculate total points and total fantasy value

The data is from the first 2 rounds (of 5 total rounds) in the file {your_filename.csv}.
